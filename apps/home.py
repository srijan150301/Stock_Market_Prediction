The entire idea of predicting stock prices is to gain significant profits. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy. ")

                 neural networks (RNNs) come in handy but recent researches have shown that LSTM,
                 networks are the most popular and useful variants of RNNs.
                 We used Keras to build a LSTM to predict stock prices using historical closing price and
                 trading volume and visualize both the predicted price values over time and the optimal
                 parameters for the model.
